# Welcome to the Studio Week 5!

This week's studio includes two different tutorials to create the final product: one for getting and simplifying data and another for creating an interactive web map for humanitarian analysis using the data.

## The Data Tutorial
Last week we focused on data sources for your maps and creating custom maps from the ground up. This week, we'll be continuing to look at data with a deep-dive into [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) or "OSM". In this tutorial we'll learn about the structure of OSM data, how to search for data we want, and download specific data for Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. You can [view Zaatari on OSM here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/32.2931/36.3227&layers=H) or learn more about the camp on the [official UN web page here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/53). The data I originally downloaded for this exercise can be found in [the data folder](data-tutorial/data), but you will download a fresh dataset to have the most recent data possible.

**What you will need:**
- an OSM account and
- a Github account for hosting your dataset.

Follow [the instructions here](data-tutorial/DATA-TUTORIAL.md) to get yourself some OSM data!

## The Analysis Tutorial
Once you have your data, you can proceed to [the analysis tutorial](analysis-tutorial/ANALYSIS-TUTORIAL.md) where we will build up a highly interactive map that allows the user to determine which points fall within a specified distance or radius by clicking a map. Our scenario is based on a common humanitarian analysis of water resources in a refugee camp.

**What you will need:**
- A code editor,
- a Github account for hosting website, and
- a Mapbox account for styling basemaps.

## Expected outputs for this week / what to submit:
Once you have completed this tutorial you will have a working web map. However, I would like you to think about ways the map could be changed to improve the goal of helping a user identify water resources in a refugee camp and then make those changes to your map. Some examples are given at the end of the analysis tutorial.

You will submit two links:
- a link to your Github repo that includes your data and the working website that it hosts, along with...
- the URL for your web map.
